# @flowtr/db

This is an abstract database core package.
It contains the functions and interfaces used by various drivers and extractors.

As of now, the file driver and yaml extractor are built in, but I plan on making them seperate from the main package.

## Concepts

Drivers load/save data from various sources,
and extractors extract this data into the correct format.

An example of this would be a yaml extractor + a file driver.

## Documentation

More documentation is coming soon.
